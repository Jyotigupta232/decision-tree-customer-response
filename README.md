Decision Tree Classifier to predict customer responses to marketing campaigns using the Bank Marketing dataset. Built during SkillCraft Internship Task 3 with focus on explainable AI and model evaluation
# Customer Response Classifier

This project is part of my **SkillCraft Technology Internship**. The goal was to build a **Decision Tree Classifier** that predicts whether a customer will respond to a marketing campaign based on the **Bank Marketing dataset**.

## Project Overview

- Cleaned and encoded features such as job, marital status, and education
- Trained a Decision Tree using scikit-learn
- Evaluated model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualized the decision tree for clear understanding of prediction logic

## Dataset

[Bank Marketing Dataset â€“ UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)

ðŸ’¡ Objective
This project highlights the importance of **explainable models** in marketing analytics, making it easier for stakeholders to trust predictions.
